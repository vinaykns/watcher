"""
This component is responsible for computing a set of potential optimization
:ref:`Actions <action_definition>` in order to fulfill the
:ref:`Goal <goal_definition>` of an :ref:`Audit <audit_definition>`.

It first reads the parameters of the :ref:`Audit <audit_definition>` from the
associated :ref:`Audit Template <audit_template_definition>` and knows the
:ref:`Goal <goal_definition>` to achieve.

It then selects the most appropriate :ref:`Strategy <strategy_definition>`
depending on how Watcher was configured for this :ref:`Goal <goal_definition>`.

The :ref:`Strategy <strategy_definition>` is then executed and generates a set
of :ref:`Actions <action_definition>` which are scheduled in time by the
:ref:`Watcher Planner <watcher_planner_definition>` (i.e., it generates an
:ref:`Action Plan <action_plan_definition>`).

See :doc:`../architecture` for more details on this component.
